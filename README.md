ML3 individual project using GANs

Executive Summary

Art has been present as long as humans have been. Cave paintings show that even the prehistoric humans also had a concept of art, which can be done to entertain and to transmit knowledge from generation to generation. Art has many forms - paintings, sculpture, literature. In this study we will explore if human beings can further the generation of art. Can neural networks, which were designed and conceptualized by humans, also learn how to make art?

The dataset that was used are jpg files of Vincent Van Gogh's paintings available from https://www.kaggle.com/ipythonx/van-gogh-paintings. Only 681 items were used, which were composed of colored compositions. The handwritten drawings were removed from the dataset and only the colored pictures were retained.

**Motivation**

Van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is known for the painting 'Starry Night'.  He has produced a lot of paintings but was only able to sell one painting when he was alive. I chose Van Gogh because his paintings have personal significance to me. The painting of Van Gogh signifies my foray into independence, as this was one of the first paintings I saw when I visited Paris (alone) for the first time in 2010. From then on, I never miss the chance to visit the Musee d' Orsay every time I am in Paris to see his incredible work.

In this study, only one painter was selected to see if the neural network can learn the style of the artist and generate similar art.

**Problem Statement**

Can neural networks be used to learn and generate art?
Can GANs learn the painting style of one particular artist?
